Foundational studies we build on (labs, who, where, what)

Room-temperature superabsorption in organic microcavities — Experimental prototype of a “quantum battery” using a dye-in-microcavity platform.
Labs & authors: University of Adelaide (IPAS), University of Sheffield, Politecnico di Milano (IFN-CNR), University of St Andrews, Heriot-Watt University (Quach, McGhee, Ganzer, Rouse, Lovett, Gauger, Keeling, Cerullo, Lidzey, Virgili). Science Advances (open access). This work directly motivates our CQD/plasmonic “quantum interfacial layer” for light-assisted charging.

Certified quantum-advantaged charger (two coupled oscillators) — Analytical proof and PRL publication of a charger-battery model that saturates the quantum speed limit; plausible implementation in superconducting circuits.
Labs & authors: Collège de France/PSL (JEIP CNRS), University of Pisa, Scuola Normale Superiore & CNR-NANO (NEST), ICFO-The Barcelona Institute of Science and Technology (Andolina, Stanzione, Giovannetti, Polini). PRL 2025 (from arXiv 2409.08627). This informs our “bench demonstrator” language and performance claims framing.

Spin quantum battery charged without external magnetic field — Integrable spin-chain protocol enabling charging by modulating internal parameters (no static B-field).
Lab: University of Genova (Ferraro, Traverso Ziani, Grazi, Sassetti). PRL 2024 reported via Phys.org. This underpins the optional “field-free” spin-battery module in our roadmap.

Mitigating self-discharge in NV-center quantum batteries — Theory showing how hyperfine interactions can slow self-discharging while preserving useful work (NV center in diamond as the battery).
Recent source: Phys.org coverage of a 2025 PRL report (Wan-Lu Song et al.). We cite it to motivate our “spin-ensemble” and “diagnostics” ideas; integration remains future R&D.

Fluoride-ion solid electrolytes — Materials basis for our solid-state, non-flammable core: BaSnF₄ and La₀.₉Ba₀.₁F₂.₉.
• BaSnF₄: structural/transport insights (stereoactive lone pairs and F⁻ disorder) from Bath/Sheffield/Manchester collaborators; JACS 2023 (open-access mirror). 
PMC

• La₀.₉Ba₀.₁F₂.₉: stability vs metal electrodes (TU Graz/ALISTORE), Nanomaterials 2019; and pressure/temperature conductivity benchmarking (ChemRxiv 2023). These papers set realistic conductivity and interface expectations.

State-of-the-field context — The 2024 Reviews of Modern Physics Colloquium summarizes quantum batteries as an active research area with early experimental hints (not yet productized). We use this to calibrate claims.
